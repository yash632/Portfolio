# Copilot instructions for this repository

Note: a repository scan found no existing AI instruction files (e.g. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENT.md`, or `README.md`). This file is a minimal, discoverable-first baseline to help an AI coding agent get productive. Update it with concrete commands and examples as the project grows.

Guiding assumptions
- This repo currently has no detectable build or language metadata. Treat the project as "empty" and ask the maintainer for the primary language, build tool, and test command before making large changes.

What to do first (high-value, discoverable checks)
1. Look for common project manifests at the repo root and top-level folders and prefer discovered scripts:
   - `package.json` (node): use `npm run` scripts; prefer `npm ci` for installs.
   - `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` (python): prefer `python -m venv .venv` + `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install .`.
   - `go.mod` (Go), `pom.xml` (Maven/Java), `build.gradle` (Gradle) — follow those tool's standard commands.
2. If you find a `README.md`, read it next — it often contains exact dev commands.
3. If you find a `.devcontainer`, `Dockerfile`, or `docker-compose.yml`, treat container commands as canonical for setting up dev environment.

Repository-specific conventions (none found yet)
- No project-specific conventions were discoverable. When present, prefer concrete in-repo scripts (e.g. `scripts/`, `tools/`, or `Makefile`) over inferred actions.

How to propose changes
- When creating or editing files, include small, focused commits and a short PR description explaining the intent.
- If you need to add build/test instructions to this file, add exact commands and where to run them (PowerShell notes below).

PowerShell / environment notes
- The environment for the primary developer is Windows PowerShell. When you include shell commands in this file or PR descriptions, prefer PowerShell-compatible syntax. Example:

  # Install node deps (PowerShell)
  npm ci

  # Create venv and install (PowerShell)
  python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt

Examples of useful, project-specific entries to add later
- If this becomes a Node project, add the exact `npm` or `pnpm` commands and which script names are canonical (e.g. `start`, `build`, `test`).
- If this becomes a Python project, add the recommended Python version and a reproducible install/test sequence.
- If multiple services exist, add a small diagram or list enumerating service folders, their responsibilities, and key ports or APIs.

When to ask the repo owner
- When the repo lacks manifests, ask these minimal questions before making changes:
  1. Primary language and required runtime versions.
  2. Preferred package manager and exact commands to build & run tests.
  3. Any monorepo/workspace layout details (service folders and how they are wired).

Maintenance
- Keep this file minimal and concrete. Replace the checklist above with exact commands once a manifest (e.g. `package.json`) is added.

If you (human) want, I can now:
- Add specific entries if you tell me the language and build/test commands.
- Search again for files after you add code and merge/extend this file.
